# C Exception

## Introduction

**C Exception**
is a library for TODO

## Installation

The git repository contains only the necessary source code.
Things like `configure` are _derived_ sources and
[should not be included in repositories](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18732931).
If you have
[`autoconf`](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/),
[`automake`](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/),
and
[`m4`](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/)
installed,
you can generate `configure` yourself by doing:

    ./bootstrap

Then follow the generic installation instructions given in
[`INSTALL`](https://github.com/paul-j-lucas/cdecl/blob/c_exception/INSTALL).

If you would like to generate the developer documentation,
you will also need
[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/);
then do:

    make doc                            # or: make docs
